# Needleman-Wunsch
This repository contains an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm used for sequence alignment. The algorithm is commonly used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences.

## Features
- Aligns two sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
- Supports custom match, mismatch, and gap penalties.
- Outputs aligned sequences along with the alignment score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/knowmili/Needleman-Wunsch.git
cd needleman-wunsch
```

2. Prepare input data in a text file
